## ‚öôÔ∏è INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN THE SERVER AND CLIENT APPLICATIONS

### üñ•Ô∏è **SERVER APPLICATION**
1. Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the `server` directory in your project.
3. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the server by executing:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. The server will now be running on:
   - The port specified in your environment variables, or 
   - Port `5000` by default.

### üåê **CLIENT APPLICATION**
1. Navigate to the `client` directory in your project.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server by executing:
   ```bash
   npm start

## üèóÔ∏è APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE AND CONCURRENCY

### **Server Side**
- The application follows a **client-server architecture** using **Node.js** and **Express.js** on the server-side, and **React** on the client-side.
- The server uses **Socket.IO** for real-time communication and concurrency handling between clients.
- **Efficient User Management**:
  - Usernames are stored in a `Map` data structure to track connected users.
  - The server ensures **unique usernames** by suggesting variations if a username is already in use.
- **Event Broadcasting**:
  - User join/leave events and chat messages are broadcasted to all connected clients (except the sender).

### **Client Side**
- Built using **React**, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Uses **Socket.IO client library** for seamless integration with the server.
- **Real-Time Interaction**:
  - Messages sent by a user are emitted to the server and broadcasted to all connected clients.
  - Received messages are displayed in real-time for a responsive and interactive experience.
- The client handles:
  - Chat interface rendering
  - User input
  - Managing the local state of the chat session.

- Modular styling applied using class names for **easy maintainability**.
- Utilizes **flexbox layout** to create a well-structured and responsive chat interface.

### **2. User Interface Design**
- **Three main views**:
  1. **Connection Container**: Displays a message when the client is not connected to the server.
  2. **Login Container**: A simple login form for entering a username and joining the chat.
  3. **Chat Application**: The main interface for sending/receiving messages and viewing the online user list.
- **Chat Interface Structure**:
  - **Header**: Displays the number of online users.
  - **Message Container**: Shows real-time chat messages.
  - **Online Users Panel**: Lists active users.
  - **Message Input**: Allows users to type and send messages.

### **3. User Experience**
- Prioritizes a **smooth and intuitive experience**:
  - Responsive design for various screen sizes.
  - Hover effects and animations for interactive elements.
